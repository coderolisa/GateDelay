# Outcome - Flight Prediction Market on Stellar

Outcome is a decentralized flight prediction market built on the Stellar network. It allows users to speculate on flight outcomes (e.g., delays, cancellations) using a transparent and trustless blockchain infrastructure, enhanced by institutional-grade AI analysis..

## 🌟 Features

- **Prediction Markets**: Participate in decentralized markets for flight arrival status.
- **AI Risk Assessment**: Integrated Llama 3.1 analysis via **Groq** for real-time trading signals and flight risk reports.
- **Real-time Aviation Data**: Automated flight tracking and market initialization powered by the **AviationStack API**.
- **Hybrid AMM**: Sophisticated Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule (LMSR) for liquidity pricing, paired with a fair cost-based payout mechanism.
- **Mantle Network**: High-performance, low-fee trading secured by Ethereum.
- **Connect with Ease**: Seamless wallet integration via **Particle Network**, supporting both social and traditional EOA logins.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Smart Contracts**:
  - Solidity 0.8.20
  - Foundry (Development & Testing)
  - PRBMath (Numerical Stability for AMM)
- **Frontend**:
